# Case Study: Airbnb (Trust)
Context: Early days. People thought sleeping in strangers' homes was weird/dangerous.
Dilemma: How to build trust between strangers?
Decision: Professional Photography. They hired pro photographers to take photos of listings.
Result: 2-3x boost in bookings.
Lesson: In a marketplace, the platform must manufacture trust. High-quality visuals are a proxy for safety.

# Case Study: Dropbox (MVP)
Context: Building a sync engine is hard.
Dilemma: How to validate demand before writing complex code?
Decision: The Fake Demo Video. Drew Houston made a video pretending to use the product.
Result: Beta waiting list went from 5k to 75k overnight.
Lesson: You don't need a product to validate demand. You need a simulation of the product.

# Case Study: Superhuman (Game Design)
Context: Email is boring work.
