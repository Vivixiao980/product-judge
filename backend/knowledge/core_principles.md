# The Mom Test (The Rules)

## Rule 1: Talk about their life instead of your idea
If you mention your idea, people will lie to you to protect your feelings.
Instead, ask about their past behavior. "When was the last time you did X?"

## Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past
Generic questions lead to generic answers ("I would definitely buy that").
Specific questions lead to truth ("I bought X last week for $50").

# True Demand (真需求)

## Pain Points vs Nice-to-Have
A true pain point is something people are already trying to solve.
If they aren't looking for a solution, it's not a problem.

## The "Everything" Trap
If your user is "everyone", you have no users.
Niche down until you can monopolize a small group.

# Case Study: Manus
Context: Early days of Manus (AI Agent).
Dilemma: Should we build a Chrome Extension or a standalone Browser?
Decision: They chose a standalone environment.
Reasoning: An extension is limited by the host's constraints. To fully control the agentic loop, they needed to own the runtime.
Lesson: If your value prop is "taking control", you cannot live inside another's walled garden.
